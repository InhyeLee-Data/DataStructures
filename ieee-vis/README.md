### 2020 IEEE VIS Conference Summary

#### My personal take: 
Data videos seem to attract viewers’ attention very effectively and often convey the underlying messages well, sometimes better than interactive data visualization with text to read. Data visualization videos made by Vox can be one successful example of such. I thought this paper might be revealing animation transition techniques of data videos, which contribute to the successful delivery of information with a hint of storytelling.

#### What are narrative transitions? 





#### Narrative Transition Example

In the video, possibly an ad of a prep school education program called “Matrix Education Tutoring College”, a boy that was studying at a desk kicks a soccer ball. The ball becomes a starting point of a chart that is getting animated and grows along with the line height. Here, a transition is made between non-visualization content to a visualization content. In the video (captured) on the bottom, the camera zooms into the circle at the end of the line. The circle is transformed into a pie chart that shows the percentage of high scores that the institution is trying to emphasize.

Authors argue that transitions as above can keep viewers oriented when states change in data videos. They also argue however, that the visualization community does not provide a comprehensive analysis on how transitions are designed and their designs for transitions are relatively one dimensional. On the other hand, video designers mainly focus on motion graphics not on visualizations, while they pay great attention to the well-made transition designs. Can we solve this problem and improve narrative transitions in data videos? This question is the focus of this paper and the authors analyzed 284 data videos and 3909 video clips to conduct a content analysis. 

#### Content Analysis of the videos and Taxonomy 


#### Taxonomy of Narrative Transitions


The specifics of transition methods are as follows.
Refresh - In this type of transitions, no connection exists between the last frame of the previous scene and the first frame of the coming scene, presenting a new topic or an abrupt turn.
Half Time - Half Time adds a new scene between videos.
Camera Motion - Camera Motion (Subtypes: Pedestal, Truck, Tilt, Pan, Dolly, Zoom, and Rack Focus.
Preserving Guide - Some visual items in the previous scene are kept and reused in the coming scenes. The layout of these visual items (orientation, size, and position) may change. These visual elements keep the integrity of the narrative information in previous scenes by preserving the same appearance, and guide viewers’ attention to a new scene by creating the layout change. This method is particularly useful in setting up a supplement, correlation, or a comparison. 
Narrative Agent - In this transition, the shape, position, and color maintain the narrative information. However, the number of the contents changes to show the differences. This method is used to highlight data or to present data sequentially.

Their future work agenda is as follows. 



#### My question 
My remaining question is then how we can combine these transition techniques in interactive data visualization’s narrative? Are data videos with animation and strong storylines somewhat a different field from interactive data visualization?
