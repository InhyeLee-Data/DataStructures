# Week6
(interim report) I've run into some issues on both projects. 
1. For the aa meeting project, I need to re-parse the necessary information. 
2. For the personal diary project, the main learning was that I needed to set up a partition key (topic, as a string) and also a sort key (dt, as a number) in order to create a composite primary key. This has been resolved.



I am following the following tutorial.
