# Week6

### 1. AA Meeting Project 
1. For the aa meeting project, I need to re-parse the necessary information. A new table has been created. 

### 2. Personal Diary Project
For the personal diary project, the main learning was that I needed to set up a partition key (topic, as a string) and also a sort key (dt, as a number) in order to create a composite primary key. Following is the primary key set up I created.
